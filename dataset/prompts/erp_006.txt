Write an ABAP class with a static method.  
Given the transactions in ztransaction and the stock in zstock, calculate the available stock for a given material mat_id.
- Starting from the current stock in zstock, simulate stock over time in order of date.
- The transaction types are "PLO" for a Planned Order and "RES" for a Reservation.
- For each ztransaction entry with matching material, adjust available stock accordingly.
- If stock drops below zero, create a new planning order with
   - id: 99999 as a temporary entry
   - transaction type: "PLO"
   - Quantity: shortage amount (positive number)
   - Date: date when shortage occurs
- Return the newly created PLO from ztransaction if one was created or initial otherwise.

Use the following database tables:
define table zstock {
  key mat_id : abap.char(20) not null;
  stock           : abap.int4 not null;
}
define table ztransaction {
  key id : abap.int4 not null;
  mat_id : abap.char(20) not null;
  transaction_type : abap.char(20) not null;
  transaction_date : abap.dats not null;
  amount : abap.int4 not null;
}
Input: 
mat_id type abap.char(20) 
Output:
current_amount type abap.int4

Example Input:
zstock = [ ("X", 3) ]
ztransaction = [
  (1, "X", "RES", "2024-06-20", -2),
  (2, "X", "PLO ", "2024-06-25", 1),
  (3, "X", "RES", "2024-06-30", -3)
]
Expected Output:
 (999999, "X", "PLO", "2024-06-30", 1)
